	LinguaPlone
		The default-page story has changed in LinguaPlone. Now the default
		strategy is to create 'language folders' like /de and /en. You can get
		that executing
		http://yourserver:port/plonesite/@@language-setup-folders It creates
		one folder for each language and sets a language 'negotiator' at the
		plone root redirecting to the proper language folder. That way, you
		can set default pages for each language.
